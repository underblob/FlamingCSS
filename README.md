# Flamingo CSS

**Flamingo CSS** is a simple responsive fluid grid framework. It has two responsive breakpoints for tablet (1250px)
and mobile (770px). The CSS grid has 12 columns rendered by default but the SASS is configurable if a smaller
footprint is desired.

The SASS can be updated to render as many or as few columns that you need by simply updating the `$total-cols` variable.

## Browser Compatibility

Flamingo uses the `box-sizing` CSS property, which is not available on all browsers. For compatibility matrix, see
